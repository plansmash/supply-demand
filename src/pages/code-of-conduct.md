- Sexual misconduct or harassment, be it verbal or physical.
- Stalking, hassling, or otherwise bullying others.

## Reporting

Employees, customers, partners and vendors are encouraged to connect with Beerlab! London ownership, either in-person, digitally or virtually, if they hear something, see something, or feel like something is going on in regards to harassment, discrimination, bullying, or any other type of unwelcomed behaviour. 

Digital reporting of this behaviour can be submitted directly to ownership by e-mail at [info@sdbeerandpizza.com](mailto:info@sdbeerandpizza.com)

Violation of this Code of Conduct will be fully investigated, and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. Consequences can range from employee coaching to immediate termination of employment.

Retaliation of any form against those who file a complaint or reach out to ownership will not be tolerated. Making a complaint in bad faith or any form of retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.
