## Can I have beer shipped to me?

We now offer shipping anywhere in Ontario. Must be 19+.

Choose your delivery method at checkout. Choose between “In-Store Pick Up” or “Ontario Delivery”

### In-Store Pick Up

- The order will be ready for pick up approximately 1 hour after the order has been received.
- Pick-up orders will receive an email notification when the order is ready.
- Pick-up can occur anytime during normal business hours.

### Ontario Shipping

- Minimum order of 6 cans qualifies for shipping.
- Orders over 24 cans (a case) will be subject to additional shipping charges.
- We will only be shipping Beerlab! 473mL cans at this time, no 32oz Crowlers. Why? Crowlers taste best fresh from the taproom.
- Please allow for 2-4 business days for shipping, once a tracking number has been created.
- Shipping is through ICS Courier.
- All Ontario shipping orders will be shipped Wednesday of each week.  
- The cut-off for Wednesday shipping is 5 pm Tuesday.  
- Currently, we only ship Ontario-wide, once a week.
